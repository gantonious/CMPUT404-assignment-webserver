CMPUT404-assignment-webserver

See requirements.org (plain-text) for a description of the project.

Make a simple webserver.

Since this project is seperated into multiple files, it takes a little bit longer for the server to start up on first launch without any of the pycache files. If the first few tests fail when running `bash runner.sh` with the failure `URLError: <urlopen error [Errno 111] Connection refused>` there is a good chance the server hasn't actually started yet. To solve this issue I added a small sleep time to `runner.sh` to ensure the server is ready before the tests are launched.
