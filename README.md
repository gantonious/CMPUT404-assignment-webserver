CMPUT404-assignment-webserver

See requirements.org (plain-text) for a description of the project.

Make a simple webserver.

Since this project is seperated into multiple files, it takes a little bit longer for the server to start up on first launch without any of the pycache files. If the first few tests fail when running `bash runner.sh` with the failure `URLError: <urlopen error [Errno 111] Connection refused>` there is a good chance the server hasn't actually started yet. Since runner.sh assumes the server has started when calling the test scripts even though the server could still be firing up. After running the server for the first time the pycache files should be created and subsequent starts should be quick. If you run `bash runner.sh` all the tests should pass.
